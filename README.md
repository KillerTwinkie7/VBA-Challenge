Module 2 Challenge

If Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> Cells(i, 1).Value Then
written by Mark, the legend, himself

Range("I:I").RemoveDuplicates Columns:=1, Header:=xlYes
I think I found this somewhere on Stack Exchange, but I wasn't really keeping track of all of that, so these are largely guesses

ActiveSheet.UsedRange.EntireRow.AutoFit     '| length to best fit data
Found this from the internet somewhere, I dunno I'm not expecting anyone else to do this and I'm just trying cover my butt, y'know?

Everything else though, I would get the syntax from other resources and adapt it to my code, which doesn't feel like something that needs referencing? I dunno, I wrote most of this myself but I'm doing this step because it asked me to in the assignment.
